# Portfolio-Challenge-2.

## Purpose
This is a learning project for CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The project is a portfolio of the work I have done up to this point in the class.  It's also intended to be my acting portfolio as the class advances.  I created the following the guidelines.  The goal of this project was to showcase the knowledge we gain from the first two modules of the course.  I went a little deeper and used CSS grid for my layout after watching a tutorial.  I then added media queries to resize the page for smaller screen sizes like phones and tablets.
